Framework: Block by Block, Understand Use Case, Install & Imitate, Land First Client, and Document & Duplicate.\n\n2. **Stage 2: AI Consulting** - Move from selling single automations to auditing businesses and designing roadmaps. Charge for clarity + implementation. Follow the S.C.A.N. Framework: Study the Business, Calculate Opportunity, Architect Solution, and Narrate Results.\n\n3. **Stage 3: Scaling into an AI Partner Agency** - Build a team to scale past personal limits. Follow the G.R.O.W. Framework: Get Developers, Retain Authority, Onboard Sales, and Win with Brand.\n\n4. **Stage 4: Teaching AI Automation** - Package expertise into content + communities for recurring, scalable profit.

For example, freelancing with AI modules can provide a relatively quick way to earn money, while scaling into an AI partner agency can lead to higher income potential but requires more effort and resources. Teaching AI automation can provide a recurring income stream but requires expertise and content creation. \n\nThe key to success in making money with AI is to start small, build proof, grow credibility, scale with a team, and teach for freedom.
